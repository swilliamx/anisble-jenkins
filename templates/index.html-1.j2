  <span><p>The Play with Kubernetes classroom is a new site provided by <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> that helps you get hands-on experience using Kubernetes. We provide a workshop that will allow you, in the browser, to follow a Kubernetes tutorial without having to install a single thing.</p></span>
